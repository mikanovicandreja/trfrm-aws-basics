AWS VPC + EC2 + RDS Infrastructure (Terraform)

This Terraform configuration provisions a custom AWS infrastructure designed for running a simple web application with a PostgreSQL backend. It creates a secure, highly-available Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment, deploys an EC2 instance with Apache + PostgreSQL client tools, and sets up an RDS PostgreSQL instance in private subnets.

*** What this code does: **
1. VPC and Networking

VPC

Creates a new VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with DNS support and hostnames enabled.

Tagged as custom-vpc.

Internet Gateway (IGW)

Provides internet access for public subnets.

Attached to the main VPC.

Subnets

Public Subnets: Two (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24) across separate Availability Zones. Instances in these subnets get public IPs.

Private Subnets: Two (10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24) also spread across AZs. Used for the RDS database.

Route Tables

Public route table with a default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the IGW.

Associated with both public subnets to enable outbound internet access.

2. Security

EC2 Security Group (allow_web&ssh)

Allows inbound:

HTTP (80) from anywhere

HTTPS (443) from anywhere

SSH (22) only from a specific static IP (45.87.212.180/32)

Allows all outbound traffic.

RDS Security Group (rds-sg)

Only allows PostgreSQL (5432) connections from EC2 instances in the allow_web&ssh security group.

Blocks all direct public access.

3. Compute

Key Pair

Uses a local SSH public key (/home/andreja/.ssh/new_key.pub) for EC2 SSH access.

Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

Automatically fetches the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI in the chosen region.

EC2 Instance

t2.micro instance launched in one of the public subnets.

Bootstrapped with User Data script that:

Updates the OS

Installs Apache (httpd) for serving web content

Installs PostgreSQL client tools for database connectivity

Adds ec2-user to Apache group for permissions

Installs mod_ssl and generates a self-signed key for HTTPS

Tagged with custom metadata (Name, Description, CostCenter).

4. Database

RDS Subnet Group

Includes both private subnets for high availability.

RDS PostgreSQL Instance

db.t3.micro, PostgreSQL 14 engine.

8 GB storage, Multi-AZ enabled.

Not publicly accessible (only available from private subnets).

Credentials defined in Terraform (‚ö†Ô∏è should be moved to a secure secrets manager in production).

Tagged as PostgreSQL-RDS.

üîó Resource Relationships

Public EC2 Instance ‚Üí Can receive traffic from the internet via the Internet Gateway and public route table.

EC2 Security Group ‚Üí Allows web traffic + restricted SSH.

EC2 ‚Üí Connects to RDS using private networking (via RDS security group).

RDS ‚Üí Isolated in private subnets, accessible only from EC2 in the VPC.

Multi-AZ setup ensures RDS is resilient across availability zones.

üåç Region and Availability

Region: us-west-1

AZs: Terraform automatically fetches available AZs and distributes resources across them for high availability.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Recommendations

Database password is hardcoded in the Terraform file (Andreja2425). For production, use AWS Secrets Manager or Terraform variables with secure storage.

SSH access is limited to one IP (good practice). Ensure you update it when your IP changes.

Self-signed SSL is used on EC2; replace with a trusted certificate for real deployments.

Cost caution: RDS with Multi-AZ enabled may incur ongoing costs even at the smallest instance size.

‚úÖ Outcome

After applying this Terraform configuration, you get:

A secure VPC with public + private subnets.

A public EC2 instance running Apache (with HTTP/HTTPS enabled) and PostgreSQL client tools.

A private RDS PostgreSQL database, isolated from the internet but reachable from EC2.

Networking and security rules that enforce a clean two-tier architecture.
